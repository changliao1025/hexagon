# hexagon

It all started with the #ECO3D model.

Later on, I extended the capability of ECO3D from watershed scale to global scale.

During the course of developement, a list of model were produced, i.e. hexwatershed, hexocean and hexcontinent.

Because all of them fundamentally require some common basis in hexagon related operations/algorithms, I decided to ship out some shared library to ease my own development.

Therefore, in this repository, focus will be on core challenge and technique instead of actual source code. Of cource, in the final stage, a well managed/documented library will be released.

Tune in the #issue tab for day to day thoughts and progresses made.

The #Projects tab will provide specific road path for individual projects.

The #Wiki tab will provide some useful information for even deeper questions asked.

Likely I will also share some updates on Twitter (@changliao1025) but most content here should be up-to-date.

Good luck!
